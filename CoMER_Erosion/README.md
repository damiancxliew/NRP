# CoMER_Erosion: Advancing Modeling Coverage for Transformer-based Handwritten Mathematical Expression Recognition with Morphological Operations
 
</div>

This project is a modified implementation of the CoMER model provided by Wenqi Zhao's Github.

Mainly based on his paper:

CoMER: Modeling Coverage for Transformer-based Handwritten Mathematical Expression Recognition

Changes: datamodule.py file found under comer folder
